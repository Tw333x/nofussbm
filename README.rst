No Fuss Bookmarks is a very simple **software** and **service** to store bookmarks especially designed for hackers (that don't need
fancy interfaces, but **nice API**).

The software is a simple RESTful server, written using `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, providing a CRUD interface to a `mongoDB
<http://www.mongodb.org/>`_ store, plus a very basic Google Chrome extension to submit bookmarks.

The service is just an incarnation of such software hosted by `heroku <http://www.heroku.com/>`_ and `mongolab
<http://mongolab.com>`_ that you can freely use just submitting your email below to obtain your API key.

For more details, please visit the `service signup page <http://nofussbm.herokuapp.com/static/signup.html>`_.
